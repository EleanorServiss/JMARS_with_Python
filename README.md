# JMARS_with_Python
This code is still under construction. Specifically, we're working to make the polygon-to-centerline process more efficient and making the code more user-friendly. If you have questions, feel free to contact Eleanor Serviss at eleanor.serviss@umontana.edu. Thank you!

This project combines JMARS with Python to create geospatial analysis tools. Current tools include polygon-to-centerline and dividing a line with a given distance. Includes instructions on how to read .csv shapefiles into coordinate array in Python.
